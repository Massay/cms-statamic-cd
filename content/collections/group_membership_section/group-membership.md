  If your company or organisation would like all its employees to access CDC membership benefits, we offer a discount with our group membership scheme.

  Group membership allows organisations to receive discounted membership subscriptions for their employees, where the memberships are purchased through a single invoice. Membership costs Â£105 per person and a discount is available if your organisation has a scheme with at least 10 members:
