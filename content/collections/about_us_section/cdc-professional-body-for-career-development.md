The Career Development Community (CDC) was formed in 2016 to set standards, advocate for, and promote high-quality career development for all. We do this by supporting people from all different backgrounds and championing the profession. We offer career guidance, provide continuous professional development (CPD) and training, and host online and face-to-face bootcamps, conferences, and events.
